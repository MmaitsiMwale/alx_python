# Python - import & modules

Python allows us to use code from other people, or code that we wrote ourselves and want to reuse it without rewriting it again. This is made handy by using the `import` call followed by the module name (file that has the code, functions or classes we want to use in our code).

task-0: Import a simple function from a simple file
task-1: How to make a script dynamic!
task-2: Everything can be imported
task-3: Integers division with debug
task-4: Raise exception
